**Disclaimer:** While some of these solutions are my own, others are based on shared ideas or approaches from the Advent of Code (AoC) community. I named this repository a "cheat sheet" to reflect its purpose as a resource for learning and collaboration. It is intended to help others participating in AoC events with Python or other programming languages, as well as to provide insights into problem-solving logic. Feedback is always welcome, so feel free to reach out! I plan to update this repository as I continue to participate in future or revisit past AoC events. Thank you for making this a shared learning journey!
